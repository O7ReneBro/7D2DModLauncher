The new 7D2D Mod Launcher is ready for testing. This is a beta version. It can co-exist with the existing Mod Launcher.

Note: The 7D2D Mod Launcher does not have an installer. Extract the zip file where you want it to exist.

To install the 7D2D Mod Launcher:

1) Download and extract: https://github.com/SphereII/7D2DModLauncher/archive/Windows.zip
2) Run 7D2DModLauncher.exe to complete the installation and start the mod launcher.


To Activate Controller / Steam Overlay / Friend support:
	In Steam, click on Add Non-Steam Game, and Browser to the 7D2DModLauncher.exe

Notes:
	By default, the 7D2D Mod Launcher will install all mods to C:\7D2D. To change this, click on Settings.
	
	7D2DModLauncher.exe is the auto-updater and start up. This is the recommended way to start.
		ModLauncher.exe skips the auto-updater, and simply starts the Mod Launcher.
